Description: A collection of useful functions not found anywhere else, mainly
    for programming: Generalized lagged differences, checking containment in an
    interval, creating a factor where the levels maintain the order of
    appearance, sampling rows from a data frame, converting seconds from
    midnight to and from H:M:S format, choosing the first non-NA value,
    transposing lists of lists, returning the name of the file currently
    sourced, smart named lists and vectors, and an alternative interface to
    assign().
