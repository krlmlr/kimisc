Description: A collection of useful functions not found anywhere else,
        mainly for programming: Pretty intervals, generalized lagged
        differences, checking containment in an interval, creating a
        factor where the levels maintain the order of appearance,
        sampling rows from a data frame, converting seconds from
        midnight to and from H:M:S format, choosing the first non-NA
        value, transposing lists of lists, returning the name of the
        file currently sourced, smart named lists and vectors, and an
        alternative interface to assign().
